<h1>CSS3 Standard Auto Hyphens</h1> <P class="std">
It was sweeping round swiftly and steadily, this flaming death, this invisible, inevitable sword of
heat. I perceived it coming towards me by the flashing bushes it touched, and was too astounded and stupefied to stir.
I heard the crackle of fire in the sand pits and the sudden squeal of a horse that was as suddenly stilled. Then it was
as if an invisible yet intensely heated finger were drawn through the heather between me and the Martians, and all
along a curving line beyond the sand pits the dark ground smoked and crackled. Something fell with a crash far away to
the left where the road from Woking station opens out on the common. Forth-with the hissing and humming ceased, and the
black, dome-like object sank slowly out of sight into the pit.
